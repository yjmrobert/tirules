title: Rerolls
---

 
## Rules Reference

  
Some game effects instruct a player to reroll dice.

 
 1. When a die is rerolled, its new result is used instead of its previous result.
 2. The same ability cannot be used to reroll the same die multiple times, but multiple abilities can be used to reroll a single die.
 3. Die rerolls must occur after rolling the dice, before other abilities are resolved.
 
 
## Notes

 
 1. Effects that reroll “combat rolls” do not reroll anti–fighter barrage, bombardment or space cannon rolls.
