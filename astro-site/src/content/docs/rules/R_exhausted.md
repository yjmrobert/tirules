## Rules Reference

  
Some cards can be exhausted. A player cannot resolve abilities or spend the resources or influence of an exhausted card.

 
1. To exhaust a card, a player flips the card facedown.
2. During the <b>Ready Cards</b> step of the status phase, each player readies all of their exhausted cards by flipping those cards faceup.
3. A player exhausts their planet cards to spend either the resources or influence on that card.
4. Abilities, including some found on technology cards, may instruct a player to exhaust a card to resolve those abilities. If a card is already exhausted, it cannot be exhausted again.
 
    1. Passive abilities on an exhausted card are still in effect while that card is exhausted.

5. After a player performs a strategic action, they exhaust the strategy card that corresponds to that action.
 
 
## Notes

 
1. Planets will also ready at the end of each agenda phase. Leaders, relics and technologies will not.
2. If a game effect instructs a player to exhaust a planet, the exhausted planet must be controlled by that player, unless the game effect specifies otherwise.
