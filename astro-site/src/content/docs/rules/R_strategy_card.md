## Rules Reference

  
Strategy cards determine initiative order and provide each player with a powerful ability that they can use one time during the action phase.

 
 1. During the strategy phase, each player chooses a strategy card from the common play area and places it in their play area faceup.
 2. Each strategy card has a readied and an exhausted side.
 
     1. The readied side contains the strategy card’s name, initiative number, and abilities.
     2. The exhausted side contains the strategy card’s initiative number.
 
 3. A player can only resolve the <b>primary</b> ability of <b>their own</b> strategy cards.
 4. A player can only resolve the <b>secondary</b> ability of strategy cards that were chosen by <b>other players</b>.
 5. There are eight strategy cards, each of which has a name and an initiative number.
 6. The initiative number on a player’s strategy card determines the initiative order for the action phase and status phase.
 7. A strategy card has both a primary ability and a secondary ability. These abilities are resolved during a strategic action.
 8. Each strategy card exists in either the common play area or a player’s play area.
 
     1. Strategy cards in the common play area are available for players to choose during the strategy phase.
     2. A strategy card in a player’s play area belongs to that player until it is returned to the common play area during the status phase.
