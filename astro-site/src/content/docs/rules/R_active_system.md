## Rules Reference

  
The active system is the system that is activated during a tactical action.

 
 1. When a player performs a tactical action, they activate a system by placing a command token from their tactic pool in that system. That system is the active system.
 2. A player <b>cannot</b> activate a system that already contains one of their command tokens.
 3. A player <b>can</b> activate a system that contains command tokens that match other players’ factions.
 4. A system remains the active system for the duration of the tactical action during which it was activated.
 
 
## Notes

 
 1. A player may only move into a nebula if it is the active system.
 2. No system is the active system during a component or strategic action.
 
    1. Effects that trigger when a system is activated will not trigger during a component or strategic action.

 3. After activating a system during a tactical action, play will proceed to the <b>Movement</b> step.
