## Rules Reference

  
Planets provide players with resources and influence. Planets are on system tiles and each has a name, a resource value, and an influence value. Some planets also have traits.

 
 1. A planet’s resources are indicated by the value on its planet card and system tile that is surrounded by a yellow triangular border.
 2. A planet’s influence is indicated by the value on its planet card and system tile that is surrounded by a blue hexagonal border.
 3. A planet’s trait has no inherent effects, but some game effects refer to a planet’s trait. There are three traits: cultural, hazardous, and industrial.
 4. Some planets have a technology specialty, which allows those planets to be exhausted to satisfy a prerequisite when researching technology.
 5. Some planets are legendary planets, as indicated by the legendary planet icon. When a player gains control of a legendary planet, they also gain control of its legendary planet ability card.
 6. Planet Card
 
Each planet has a corresponding planet card that displays its name, resource value, influence value, and trait, if it has one. If a player controls a planet, they keep that planet’s card in their play area.

 7. A planet card has both a readied and exhausted state. When a planet is readied, it is placed faceup. When a planet is exhausted, it is placed facedown.
 8. A player can spend a readied planet’s resources or influence.
 9. A player cannot spend an exhausted planet’s resources or influence.
 
 
## Notes

 
 1. Mecatol Rex and planets in home systems do not have traits.
 2. Planets with traits can be explored.
 3. A planet cannot be spent for both its influence and resources during a single exhaustion.
 4. If a planet is exhausted for its technology specialty, it does not provide influence or resources.
 5. A player may only exhaust their own planets, unless a game effect specifies otherwise.
