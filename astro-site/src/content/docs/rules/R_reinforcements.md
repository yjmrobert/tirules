## Rules Reference

  
A player’s reinforcements is that player’s personal supply of units and command tokens that are not on the game board or otherwise in use.

 
 1. The components in a player’s reinforcements are limited.
 
 
## Notes

 
 1. If a player wishes to place a unit, but there are none of that type left in their reinforcements, they may remove a unit of that type from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead.
 2. Command tokens on a player’s command sheet are not in that player’s reinforcements.
 3. Captured units are not in any player’s reinforcements.
