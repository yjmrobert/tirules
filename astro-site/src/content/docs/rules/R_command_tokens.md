## Rules Reference

  
Command tokens are a currency that players use to perform actions and expand their fleets.

 
 1. Each player begins the game with eight tokens on their command sheet: three in their tactic pool, three in their fleet pool, and two in their strategy pool.
 
     1. Command tokens in the strategy and tactic pool are placed with the faction symbol faceup.
     2. Command tokens in the fleet pool are placed with the ship silhouette faceup.
 
 2. When a player gains a command token, they choose which of their three pools to place it in.
 3. A player is limited by the amount of command tokens in their reinforcements.
 
     1. If a player would gain a command token but has none available in their reinforcements, that player cannot gain that command token.
     2. If a game effect would place a player’s command token from their reinforcements and none are available, that player must take a token from a pool on their command sheet, unless the token would be placed into a system that already contains one of their command tokens.
 
 4. During the action phase, a player can perform a tactical action by spending a command token from their tactic pool; they place the command token in a system.
 5. After a player performs a strategic action during the action phase, each other player can resolve the secondary ability of that strategy card by spending a command token from their strategy pool.
 
    1. A player does not spend a command token to resolve the secondary ability of the <i>Leadership</i> strategy card.

 6. If a game effect would place a player’s command token in a system where they already have one, they place the token in their reinforcements instead. Any effects that resolve by placing that token are resolved as normal.
