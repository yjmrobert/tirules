## Rules Reference

 
There currently does not exist a Living Rules Reference section regarding space stations.

 
## Notes

 
1. Several systems contain space stations, which are mechanically similar to planets.
2. A player gains control of a space station when they are the only player with units in that space station’s system.
 
    1. If another player moves ships into that system, they will not gain control of that space station unless they win the resulting space combat.
    2. If the player who controls the space station moves their ships out of the system, they retain control of that space station until another player moves ships in.
 
3. Each space station has a corresponding planet card. The space station may be exhausted for resources or influence as though it were a planet. The space station will be readied during the status phase as though it were a planet, or by other game effects that can ready planets.
4. Structures and ground forces cannot be committed to or placed on a space station.
5. Space stations do not count as planets for the purpose of voting, or scoring objectives, and a player may still score public objectives even if another player controls a space station in their home system.
6. For each space station a player controls, their commodity value is increased by one.
 
    1. Players may place a space station commodity token in the commodity area of their faction sheet as a reminder of their increased commodity value.
    2. If a player loses control of a space station, and they now have more commodities than their newly decreased commodity value, they must remove the excess and return them to the supply.
 
7. A player who controls one or more space stations may resolve transactions with other players who control one or more space stations.
 
    1. Players who resolve transactions in this manner need not be neighbors. However, the space stations will not make those players neighbors for other game effects.
    2. Space stations do not allow players to perform more than one transaction with each other player during each turn of the action phase, or during each agenda of the agenda phase.
 
8. A player may exhaust a space station at any time to convert any commodities that they have into trade goods.
 
    1. If a player converts commodities in this manner, the resulting trade goods are not treated as being gained for the purpose of triggering other abilities.

9. If a system tile contains a space station, but no planets, then a frontier token will be placed in that system during game setup.
