## Rules Reference

  
Combat is an attribute of some units that is presented on faction sheets and unit upgrade technology cards.

 
1. During combat, if a unit’s combat roll produces a result equal to or greater than its combat value, it produces a hit.
2. If a unit’s combat value contains two or more burst icons, instead of rolling a single die, the player rolls one die for each burst icon when making that unit’s combat rolls.
 
 
## Notes

 
1. The “0” side of the d10 represents a result of 10.
