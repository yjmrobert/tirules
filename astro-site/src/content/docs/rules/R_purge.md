Purge is a cost that permanently removes a component from the game. If an ability requires that its component is purged, that component can only be used once per game.

 
1. If an ability instructs a player to purge a component, that component is removed from the game and returned to the box.
2. Purged components cannot be used or otherwise returned to the game by any means.
3. When a player is instructed to purge a component, that component is purged even if its ability was only partially resolved.
