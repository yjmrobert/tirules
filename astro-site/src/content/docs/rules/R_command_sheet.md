title: Command Sheet
---

 
## Rules Reference

  
Each player has a command sheet that contains a strategy pool, a tactic pool, a fleet pool, a trade good area, and a quick reference.

 
 1. The pools on the command sheet are where players place their command tokens. Command tokens in a player’s pools are used by that player to perform strategic and tactical actions and to increase the number of ships that player can have in each system.
 2. The trade good area on the command sheet is where a player places their trade good tokens; trade tokens in a player’s trade good area can be spent by that player as resources, influence, or to resolve certain game effects that require trade goods.
 3. Players who are familiar with the game can hide the quick reference by placing that portion of the command sheet under their faction sheets.
 
 
## Notes

 
 1. When a command token is gained, it may be placed in any of the three pools if no specific pool is specified by the gaining effect.
