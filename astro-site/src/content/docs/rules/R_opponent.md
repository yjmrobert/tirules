## Rules Reference

  
During combat, a player’s opponent is the other player that either has ships in the system at the start of the space combat or has ground forces on the planet at the start of a ground combat.

 
1. Players who do not have units on either side of a combat are not opponents. Those players cannot use abilities or have abilities used against them that are used against an opponent.
