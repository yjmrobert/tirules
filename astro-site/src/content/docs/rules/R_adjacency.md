title: Adjacency

## Rules Reference

  
Two system tiles are adjacent to each other if any of the tiles’ sides are touching each other.

 
1. A system that has a wormhole is treated as being adjacent to a system that has a matching wormhole.
2. A unit or planet is adjacent to all system tiles that are adjacent to the system tile that contains that unit or planet.
 
    1. A system is not adjacent to itself.

3. A planet is treated as being adjacent to the system that contains that planet.
4. Systems that are connected by lines drawn across one or more hyperlane tiles are adjacent for all purposes.
 
 
## Notes

 
1. A unit is not adjacent to the system it is in.
2. The Wormhole Nexus and the Creuss home system are only adjacent to tiles via wormholes.
