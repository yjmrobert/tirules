## Rules Reference

  
A ship is a unit type consisting of carriers, cruisers, dreadnoughts, destroyers, fighters, and war suns. Each race also has a unique flagship.

 
 1. Ships are always placed in space.
 2. A player can have a number of ships in a system equal to or less than the number of command tokens in that player’s fleet pool.
 
    1. Fighters do not count toward the fleet pool limit, and instead count against a player’s capacity.

 3. Ships can have any number of the following attributes: cost, combat, move, and capacity. These attributes are shown on faction sheets and unit upgrade technology cards.
 
 
## Notes

 
 1. A Fighter II may count towards either the fleet pool limit or a player’s capacity.
