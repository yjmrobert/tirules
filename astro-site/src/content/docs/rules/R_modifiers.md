## Rules Reference

  
A modifier is a number that is applied by an ability to increase or decrease the attribute values of a unit or the results of a die roll.

 
 1. A modifier is always preceded by the word “apply” followed by a numerical value.
 2. A modifier value preceded by a “+” is added to the attribute or result being modified; a modifier value preceded by a “−” is subtracted from the attribute or result being modified.
 
 
## Notes

 
 1. “Combat roll” modifiers do not modify anti–fighter barrage, bombardment or space cannon rolls.
 2. When an effect moves a unit to an adjacent system, modifying that unit’s move value will have no effect.
