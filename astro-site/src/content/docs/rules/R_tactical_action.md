title: Tactical Action
---

 
## Rules Reference

  
The tactical action is the primary method by which players produce units, move ships, and extend their dominion within the galaxy. To perform a tactical action, the active player performs the following steps:

 
1. <b>Step 1 – Activation</b>: The active player must activate a system that does not contain one of their command tokens.
 
    1. To activate a system, the active player places a command token from their tactic pool in that system. That system is the active system.
    2. Other players’ command tokens do not prevent a player from activating a system.
 
2. <b>Step 2 – Movement</b>: The active player may move any number of ships that have a sufficient move value from any number of systems that do not contain one of their command tokens into the active system, following the rules for movement.
 
    1. Ships that have capacity values can transport ground forces and fighters when moving.
    2. The player may choose to not move any ships.
    3. After the <b>Move Ships</b> step, all players can use the Space Cannon abilities of their units in the active system.
 
3. <b>Step 3 – Space Combat</b>: If two players have ships in the active system, those players must resolve a space combat.
 
    1. If the active player is the only player with ships in the system, they skip this step.

4. <b>Step 4 – Invasion</b>: The active player may use their Bombardment abilities, commit units to land on planets, and resolve ground combat against other players’ units.
5. <b>Step 5 – Production</b>: The active player may resolve each of their unit’s Production abilities in the active system.
 
    1. The active player may do this even if they did not move units or land ground forces during this tactical action.

 
 
## Notes

 
1. Each of these five steps happen during every tactical action, unless explicitly skipped; the active player does not have to choose between fighting a combat or producing units, for example.
2. Any abilities that occur at the end of an action happen before any abilities that occur at the end of a player’s turn.
