title: Cost (Attribute)
---

 
## Rules Reference

  
Cost is an attribute of some units that is presented on faction sheets and unit upgrade technology cards. A unit’s cost determines the number of resources a player must spend to produce that unit.

 
1. To produce a unit, a player must spend a number of resources equal to or greater than the cost of the unit they are producing.
2. If the cost is accompanied by two icons – typically for fighters and ground forces – a player produces two of that unit for that cost.
3. If a unit does not have a cost, it cannot be produced.
 
    1. Structures do not have costs and are usually placed by resolving the <i>Construction</i> strategy card.

 
 
## Notes

 
1. Whenever a unit is produced, its cost must be paid, unless the effect that is producing the unit explicitly says otherwise.
2. A player does not have to pay a unit’s cost to resolve that unit’s Deploy ability. However, the Deploy ability itself may have a cost that must be paid.
