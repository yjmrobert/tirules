## Rules Reference

  
A nebula is an anomaly that affects movement and combat.

 
 1. A ship can only move into a nebula if it is the active system.
 
    1. A ship cannot move through a nebula. That is, a ship cannot move into and out of a nebula during the same movement.

 2. A ship that begins the <b>Movement</b> step of a tactical action in a nebula treats its move value as “1” for the duration of that step.
 
    1. Other abilities and effects can increase this number.

 3. If a space combat occurs in a nebula, the defender applies +1 to each combat roll of their ships during that combat.
 
 
## Notes

 
 1. A player cannot retreat (or similar) into a nebula, since it would not be the active system.
 2. The +1 modifier for the defender does not modify anti–fighter barrage, bombardment or space cannon rolls.
 3. The +1 modifier for the defender has no effect during ground combat.
 4. A future rule change will place the ship movement restrictions of anomalies upon all units.
 5. A future rule change will allow ships to move into a nebula when it is not the active system.
