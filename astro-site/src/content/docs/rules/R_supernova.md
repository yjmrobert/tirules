## Rules Reference

  
A supernova is an anomaly that affects movement.

 
1. A ship cannot move through or into a supernova.
 
 
## Notes

 
1. If a ship finds itself in a supernova by some uncommon game effect, it may remain there and move out without harm.
2. A future rule change will place the ship movement restrictions of anomalies upon all units.
