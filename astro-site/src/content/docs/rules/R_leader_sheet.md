## Rules Reference

  
Each player has a leader sheet that contains slots for their faction’s three leader cards as well as their faction’s mech unit card. 

 
1. The leader slots of the leader sheet are where players place their three leader cards during setup. Each slot displays the name of the type of leader that is placed in that slot (agent, commander, and hero) as well as a symbol in the upper–right that helps players quickly determine which side of those leaders begins the game faceup.
 
    1. The sides of the leader cards that display one (agent), two (commander), or three (hero) hash marks, respectively, begin the game faceup.
