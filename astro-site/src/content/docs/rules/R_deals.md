## Rules Reference

  
A deal is an agreement between two players that may or may not include a transaction that involves physical components.

 
1. Players can make deals with each other at any time, even if they are not neighbors. However, deals that include a transaction must follow the rules for transactions, including that the players be neighbors.
2. Deals are binding or non–binding according to the conditions of the deal.
3. If the terms of a deal can be resolved immediately, it is a binding deal. When a deal is binding, a player must adhere to the terms of the agreement and whatever transactions, if any, were agreed upon.
 
    1. The results of playing an action card, including the act of successfully resolving a card, are not instantaneous and cannot be guaranteed. They cannot be part of a binding deal.

4. If the terms of a deal cannot be resolved immediately, it is a non–binding deal. When a deal is non–binding, a player does not have to adhere to any part of the agreement.
 
 
## Notes

 
1. In general, only the terms of the deal that a player can immediately perform, even without the deal taking place, are binding. For example:
 
    1. If a player has four resources available during the <b>Production</b> step of a tactical action, another player may give them four trade goods on the condition that they produce a dreadnought during this <b>Production</b> step. As the active player could produce a dreadnought with the resources, this deal is binding.
    2. If instead the active player has zero resources available, the same deal would be non–binding.
 
2. The following are further examples of non–binding deals:
 
    1. Making a deal to use a promissory note in a specific way, before the promissory note has been transacted.
    2. Making a deal to not make use of a unit’s Space Cannon ability during a tactical action, before ships have been moved.
    3. Making a deal to trade commodities in exchange for the active player to replenish another player’s commodities during the resolution of the primary ability of the <i>Trade</i> strategic action.
    4. Making a deal for a player to vote on an agenda in a certain way, when it is not yet that player’s opportunity to vote.
    5. Any deal that will resolve after dice are rolled.
