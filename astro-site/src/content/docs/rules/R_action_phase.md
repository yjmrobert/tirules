title: Action Phase
---

 
## Rules Reference

  
During the action phase, each player takes a turn in initiative order. During a player’s turn, they perform a single action. After each player has taken a turn, player turns begin again in initiative order. This process continues until all players have passed.

 
1. During a player’s turn, they may perform one of the following three types of actions: a strategic action, a tactical action, or a component action.
2. If a player cannot perform an action, they must pass.
3. After a player has passed, they have no further turns and cannot perform additional actions during that action phase.
 
    1. During a turn that a player passes, they can resolve transactions and “at the start of your turn” abilities.
    2. A player that has passed can still resolve the secondary ability of other players’ strategy cards.
    3. It is possible for a player to perform multiple, consecutive actions during an action phase if all other players have passed during that action phase.
 
4. A player cannot pass until they have performed the strategic action of their strategy card.
 
    1. During a three–player or four–player game, a player cannot pass until they have exhausted both of their strategy cards.

5. After all players have passed, play proceeds to the status phase.
 
 
## Notes

 
1. Players may still play non–component action action cards after they have passed.
2. Any abilities that occur at the end of an action happen before any abilities that occur at the end of a player’s turn.
3. A player may resolve “at the start of your turn” and “at the end of your turn” abilities on the turn that they pass.
4. If all other players have passed, a player will continue to resolve “at the start of your turn” and “at the end of your turn” abilities.
