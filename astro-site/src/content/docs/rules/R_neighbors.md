title: Neighbors
---

 
## Rules Reference

  
Two players are neighbors if they both have a unit or control a planet in the same system. They are also neighbors if they both have a unit or control a planet in systems that are adjacent to each other.

 
1. Players can resolve transactions with their neighbors.
2. Players are neighbors if the adjacency of systems is granted by a wormhole.
3. Players are neighbors with the Ghosts of Creuss if the Ghosts of Creuss’ “Quantum Entanglement” faction ability is causing adjacency from the perspective of the Ghosts of Creuss player.
 
 
## Notes

 
1. A player may make a deal with any player, however, these deals may only include a transaction if the two players are neighbors.
2. A player may resolve one transaction with each other player per each agenda during the agenda phase, however, the agenda phase does not make all players neighbors.
