## Rules Reference

  
A unit is represented by a plastic figure.

 
 1. There are three types of units: ships, ground forces, and structures.
 2. Each color of plastic comes with the following units:
 
     - 3 Space Docks
     - 6 PDS units
     - 8 Destroyers
     - 8 Cruisers
     - 2 War Suns
     - 12 Infantry
     - 10 Fighters
     - 4 Carriers
     - 5 Dreadnoughts
     - 1 Flagship
     - 4 Mechs
 
 3. Units exist either on the game board or in a player’s reinforcements.
 
 
## Notes

 
 1. If an effect allows a player produce a ship of a specific type, then factional variations do not prevent that player from producing that type of ship.
 2. Units are component limited.
 
    1. Fighters and infantry are semi–limited, via the use of tokens.
