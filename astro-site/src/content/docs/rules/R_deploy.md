## Rules Reference

  
Some units have deploy abilities. Deploy abilities are indicated by the Deploy header and provide the means to place specific units on the game board without producing them as normal.

 
1. A player can use a unit’s Deploy ability when the ability’s conditions are met to place that unit on the game board.
 
    1. A player does not have to spend resources to deploy a unit unless otherwise specified.

2. A player can only resolve a Deploy ability to place a unit that is in their reinforcements.
 
    1. If there are no units that have a Deploy ability in a player’s reinforcements, the Deploy ability cannot be used.

3. A unit’s Deploy ability can be resolved only once per timing window.
