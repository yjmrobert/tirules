## Rules Reference

 
There currently does not exist a Living Rules Reference section regarding The Fracture.

 
## Notes

 
 1. The Fracture consists of additional systems beyond the regular bounds of the game map.
 2. When a player gains their breakthrough, they roll a dice. On a result of 1 or 10, The Fracture enters play. Other game effects may also bring The Fracture into play.
 
    1. The “0” side of the d10 represents a result of 10.

 3. When The Fracture enters play, it is placed against the edge of the regular game map.
 
     1. The placement location of The Fracture is arbitrary, and should have no mechanical effect on the game state. The Fracture may be moved if required at a later point during the game.
     2. All systems in The Fracture, as well as the systems of the regular game map that they are touching, are considered to be on the edge of the game board.
 
 4. When The Fracture is brought into play, neutral units are placed on the planets in The Fracture as well as the space area of those planets’ systems, as indicated on the reverse side of The Fracture tiles.
 5. When The Fracture is brought into play, several ingress tokens will be placed on the game board. Several systems in The Fracture contain a printed egress. Each ingress is adjacent to each egress, and vice versa. An ingress is not adjacent to an ingress and an egress is not adjacent to an egress.
 
    1. With sufficient movement, a ship could move from a system containing an ingress in the regular game map, into a system containing an egress within The Fracture, and then out to a different system containing an ingress in the regular game map. A ship could also do the reverse to travel from an egress to a different egress via an ingress.

 6. If The Fracture was brought into play as a result of a player rolling a dice upon gaining their breakthrough, they will place ingress tokens according to the synergy on their breakthrough. For each color of technology in their breakthrough’s synergy, they choose three planets with a matching technology specialty, and place an ingress token in that planet’s system.
 
    1. If there are fewer than three planets with a technology specialty of a given color, as many planets as possible are chosen.

 7. If a different game effect places The Fracture into play, or The Fracture enters play because of the Nekro player’s breakthrough (which does not have a synergy), then the player that caused The Fracture to enter play chooses one planet with a technology specialty for each of the four colors of technology, and places ingress tokens in each of those planets’ systems.
 8. If one system contains two planets with a technology specialty, only one of those planets may be chosen when placing ingress tokens.
 9. After ingress tokens are placed with either of these two methods, one additional ingress token is placed. If Thunder’s Edge is on the game board, then an ingress token is place into its system. Otherwise, an ingress token is placed into the Mecatol Rex system.
 10. A system cannot contain two or more ingress tokens.
 11. When a player gains control of a planet in The Fracture that is not already controlled by another player, they draw one relic card.
