## Unrelenting

 
 1. Unrelenting does not affect anti–fighter barrage, bombardment or space cannon rolls.
 
 
## Tekklar Legion (Promissory Note)</sub>

 
 1. <i>Tekklar Legion</i> does not affect anti–fighter barrage, bombardment or space cannon rolls.
 
 
## Valkyrie Particle Weave (Technology)</sub>

 
 1. The hit produced by <i>Valkyrie Particle Weave</i> is added to any other hits produced in the immediately preceding <b>Roll Dice</b> step.
 
    1. <i>Valkyrie Particle Weave</i> produces a hit before any hits may be cancelled. Cancelling the original hits will not cause the additional hit to be cancelled.

 2. The N’orr player producing zero hits with their combat roll will not prevent <i>Valkyrie Particle Weave</i> from producing an additional hit.
 3. If the opponent produces a hit, <i>Valkyrie Particle Weave</i> mandatorily produces a hit.
 
 
## Exotrireme (Unit)</sub>

 
 1. When resolving the ability of an Exotrireme II, the N’orr player chooses which ships are destroyed.
 
    1. The N’orr cannot choose their own ships as targets.

 2. Effects that cancel hits, such as the Sustain Damage ability, cannot be used to prevent ships from being destroyed.
 3. If a player retreats, the N’orr player will be unable to use the ability of an Exotrireme II to destroy an opponent’s ship.
 4. If the N’orr player is in a combat with the Yin player, then the two players will alternate when resolving end of combat round abilities, starting with the attacker.
 
 
## C’morran N’orr (Flagship)</sub>

 
 1. <i>C’morran N’orr</i> does not affect anti–fighter barrage, bombardment or space cannon rolls.
 
 
## T’ro (Agent)</sub>

 
 
 
## G’hom Sek’kus (Commander)</sub>

 
 1. Planets in the home system of an eliminated player will not contribute to unlocking G’hom Sek’kus.
 2. This ability allows the N’orr player to commit ground forces to a planet even if they have no ships in the active system.
 3. The <i>Parley</i> action card will place the committed ground forces in the space area of the active system. If the N’orr player does not have enough capacity in the space area for the extra ground forces, including zero capacity, they will have to remove fighters and ground forces to meet capacity limits.
 4. The N’orr player may commit up to one ground force from each eligible planet during each <b>Invasion</b> step, regardless of the number of planets they are committing ground forces to.
 5. The N’orr player may only commit ground forces as the active player.
 6. Only the active player may use the Bombardment ability of their units during an invasion. As such, any ships in the active system will be unable to use their Bombardment ability unless they belong to the N’orr player.
 
    1. This prevents the L1Z1X player from using their Harrow faction ability, unless they have the N’orr <i>Alliance</i> promissory note and they are the active player.

 7. Another player may still produce hits against the N’orr player’s ground forces committed using G’hom Sek’kus during the <b>Space Cannon Defense</b> step.
 8. The N’orr player must legally be able to move into the destination system in order to commit ground forces with G’hom Sek’kus
 
     1. If another player plays the N’orr player’s <i>Ceasefire</i> promissory note, they cannot commit any ground forces to planets in the active system during this action, other than ground forces already in the active system.
     2. The N’orr player cannot commit ground forces to Mirage if it is in an asteroid field, unless the N’orr player owns the <i>Antimass Deflectors</i> technology.
     3. The N’orr player cannot commit ground forces to Mirage if it is in a supernova. Another player may do so if they own the <i>Magmus Reactor</i> Muaat faction technology and the N’orr player’s Alliance promissory note.
     4. If the N’orr player commits any ground forces from a gravity rift system, those ground forces must roll for removal.
     5. The N’orr player cannot commit ground forces through a wormhole if the <i>Enforced Travel Ban</i> law is in play.
 
 9. The N’orr player may use this ability to commit ground forces to any planet in the active system, regardless of who, if anyone, controls it.
 10. If the N’orr player purges the <i>Dominus Orb</i> relic during the <b>Movement</b> step of a tactical action, they may use G’hom Sek’kus to commit ground forces from systems that contain their command tokens during that tactical action.
 11. The <b>Commit Ground Forces</b> step is entirely resolved before the <b>Establish Control</b> step (with other steps between). When the N’orr player gains control of their fifth non–home system planet, an unlocks G’hom Sek’kus, they cannot then use G’hom Sek’kus to commit additional ground forces during that tactical action.
 12. Ground forces cannot be committed to a planet if it has the <i>Demilitarized Zone</i> exploration card attached.
 
 
## Sh’val, Harbinger — Tekklar Conditioning (Hero)</sub>

 
 1. The <i>Parley</i> action card will place the committed ground forces in the space area of the active system. As the N’orr player will not have enough capacity in the space area for their ground forces, they will have to remove all ground forces from that planet, that are now in the space area of that system.
 2. The <b>Space Cannon Offense</b>, <b>Space Combat</b> and <b>Bombardment</b> steps are skipped.
 3. Another player may still produce hits against the N’orr player’s ground forces committed using <i>Tekklar Conditioning</i> during the <b>Space Cannon Defense</b> step.
 4. Any abilities that trigger “after a player moves ships…” or similar cannot be used following <i>Tekklar Conditioning</i>.
 
 
## Valkyrie Exoskeleton (Mech)</sub>

 
 1. The hit produced by the Valkyrie Exoskeleton is added to any other hits produced in the immediately preceding <b>Roll Dice</b> step.
 2. If a Valkyrie Exoskeleton uses its Sustain Damage ability during a ground combat, it mandatorily produces a hit.
 
 
## N’orr Supremacy (Breakthrough)</sub>

 
 1. The N’orr player must meet the prerequisites of the unit upgrade technology they research.
