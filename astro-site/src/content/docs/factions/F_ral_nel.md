## Survival Instinct

 
 1. If the moved ships were in a gravity rift, they must roll for removal.
 
 
## Miniaturization

 
 1. Structures will be placed at the end of the tactical action. This will be after the production step, and so any space docks placed cannot use their Production ability during the same action.
 
 
## Nano–Link Permit (Promissory Note)</sub>

 
 1. The moved structures may use their unit abilities during the tactical action that they are moved.
 2. The structures are moved directly to the planet; they are not transported.
 
 
## Nanomachines (Technology)</sub>

 
 1. When the Ral Nel player exhausts <i>Nanomachines</i>, they perform only one of the three component actions listed on the card.
 2. If the Ral Nel player has no PDS in their reinforcements when performing the first ability, they may remove one from a system that does not contain one of their command tokens to place it on a planet they control.
 3. The Ral Nel player may perform the second ability even if they have no damaged units, or even if they have no units with the Sustain Damage ability on the game board.
 4. The Ral Nel player must have at least one action card in their hand to perform the third ability.
 5. When performing the third ability, the Ral Nel player chooses which card they will discard before seeing which card they will draw.
 
 
## Linkship (Unit)</sub>

 
 
 
## Last Dispatch (Flagship)</sub>

 
 1. A unit with Sustain Damage cannot be destroyed, even if it is damaged.
 
    1. If a unit loses the Sustain Damage ability, such as a war sun by the effect of the <i>Publicize Weapon Schematics</i> agenda, then that unit may be destroyed with the ability of the <i>Last Dispatch</i>.

 2. The Ral Nel player chooses which ship is destroyed.
 3. If the Ral Nel player plays the <i>Skilled Retreat</i> action card, they cannot resolve the ability of the <i>Last Dispatch</i>.
 
 
## Kan Kip Rel (Agent)</sub>

 
 1. The action card that the Ral Nel player gives to another player must be one of the two that they drew, and not another action card from their hand.
 2. If the Yssaril player duplicates the effect of Kan Kip Rel with Ssruu, their agent, they will trigger Scheming. They will draw three action cards, and give one of those three to another player. They will then add the remaining two to their hand, and then discard any action card from their hand.
 
 
## Watchful Ojz (Commander)</sub>

 
 1. If the Ral Nel player moves all their remaining ships, the combat ends immediately.
 2. The Ral Nel player may transport fighters and ground forces if they move a ship with capacity.
 3. The destination system may contain a planet controlled by another player, which may also have that player’s ground forces on it.
 4. If the active system is a gravity rift, the moved ships must roll for removal.
 
 
## Director Nel — Signal Intrusion (Hero)</sub>

 
 1. <i>Signal Intrusion</i> may be triggered by the Ral Nel player themself passing.
 2. The Ral Nel player may take any number of turns after unpassing, before they pass again, which will end the action phase.
 3. When the Ral Nel player passes again, they may score the <i>Prove Endurance</i> secret objective.
 
 
## Alarum (Mech)</sub>

 
 
 
## Data Skimmer (Breakthrough)</sub>

 
 1. Action cards discarded by the Ral Nel player are placed in the action card discard pile, and not on <i>Data Skimmer</i>.
 2. An action card will be placed on <i>Data Skimmer</i> if it is discarded after being played or cancelled, if it is discarded due to hand size limits, or if it is discarded for another game effect.
 3. Action cards on <i>Data Skimmer</i> are not in the discard pile. They cannot be retrieved by abilities such as that of <i>The Codex</i> relic.
