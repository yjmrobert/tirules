## Zeal

 
 1. Additional votes must be cast for the same outcome as the other votes the Argent player cast.
 
    1. If the Argent player abstains or otherwise casts zero votes, they cannot cast additional votes.

 2. The Argent player always votes first, even if they are the speaker.
 3. Other players vote in their regular order after the Argent player votes; clockwise starting with the player to the left of the speaker (skipping over the Argent player as necessary).
 
 
## Raid Formation

 
 1. The <b>Anti–Fighter Barrage</b> step happens during each space combat, even if no fighters are present in the system.
 2. Raid Formation occurs when hits are produced, not after hits are assigned. As such, cancelling any hits will not prevent an opponent’s ships from becoming damaged.
 
    1. If any of the anti–fighter barrage dice are rerolled, the number of ships that become damaged will depend only on the rerolled values.

 3. The Argent player may choose a damaged ship. This will have no effect.
 4. The chosen ship becomes damaged, it does not use its Sustain Damage ability. As such, effects that trigger when a ship uses its Sustain Damage ability, such as the <i>Direct Hit</i> or <i>Reflective Shielding</i> action cards, cannot be played.
 
     1. The chosen ship may be repaired by the <i>Duranium Armor</i> technology later in the same round of combat.
     2. If the Letnev player owns their <i>Non–Euclidean Shielding</i> faction technology, this will not reduce the number of ships that the Argent player chooses.
     3. The ships cannot be repaired by the effect of the Empyrean player’s flagship, the Dynamo.
 
 5. If the Argent player plays the <i>Waylay</i> action card, hits in excess of their opponent’s fighters will first cause chosen ships to become damaged, then those same hits must still be assigned.
 
    1. For example, say the opponent has three fighters and three dreadnoughts, undamaged. The Argent player plays <i>Waylay</i>, and rolls five hits. This allows them to cause two of the dreadnoughts to become damaged. The opponent then has to assign all five hits. The final dreadnought may use its Sustain Damage ability to cancel one of those hits.

 6. If the Argent player is in combat with the Nekro player, and the Nekro player has their mechs participating in the space combat via the effects of <i>The Alastor</i>, those mechs may become damaged by the effect of Raid Formation.
 
 
## Strike Wing Ambuscade (Promissory Note)</sub>

 
 
 
## Aerie Hololattice (Technology)</sub>

 
 1. The planet with “Production 1” is considered to be on itself for the purposes of producing ground forces.
 2. A player with the <i>Light/Wave Deflector</i> technology cannot move their ships through systems containing the Argent player's structures, if the Argent player owns <i>Aerie Hololattice</i>.
 
 
## Strike Wing Alpha (Unit)</sub>

 
 1. When a Strike Wing Alpha II rolls a 9 or 10 for their anti–fighter barrage ability, infantry are destroyed at the end of the <b>Roll Dice</b> step. This occurs before any ship may use its Sustain Damage ability at the start of the <b>Assign Hits</b> step.
 2. Effects that cancel hits, such as the <i>Shields Holding</i> action card, cannot prevent the infantry from being destroyed. If an effect rerolls any anti–fighter barrage dice, the new result will determine how many infantry are destroyed.
 3. If the last of a player’s ground forces are destroyed by the ability of a Strike Wing Alpha II, and that player meets the other conditions for elimination, that player is immediately eliminated. All of their units are removed from the board, and the Argent player wins the combat.
 
 
## Quetzecoatl (Flagship)</sub>

 
 1. A player may still use the Space Cannon ability of their units against the Argent player’s ground forces during the <b>Space Cannon Defense</b> step of an invasion in this system.
 
 
## Trilossa Aun Mirik (Agent)</sub>

 
 
 
## Trrakan Aun Zulok (Commander)</sub>

 
 1. Ships that gain Bombardment due to the <i>Blitz</i> action card will contribute to the unlock condition.
 
    1. The <i>Experimental Battlestation</i> action card will not contribute.

 2. “Combat” is a unit attribute, not a unit ability.
 
 
## Mirik Aun Sissiri — Helix Protocol (Hero)</sub>

 
 1. Fighters may be moved without being transported.
 2. Ships in systems with one of the Argent player’s command tokens may move.
 3. Ships may transport units only if their origin system does not contain one of the Argent player’s command tokens.
 
    1. A future rule change will allow a player’s ships to transport units from systems that contain that player’s command token when those ships move outside of a tactical action.

 4. Ships move directly to their destination system. They may only transport units from their origin system.
 5. Ships moving out of a gravity rift must roll for removal.
 6. Ships cannot move into a nebula or supernova, even if it contains one of the Argent player’s command tokens.
 
    1. Ships may travel into an asteroid field only if the Argent player has the <i>Antimass Deflectors</i> technology.

 7. <i>Helix Protocol</i> may be used to move ships into the wormhole nexus. If the nexus is inactive, this will cause it to activate.
 
 
## Aerie Sentinel (Mech)</sub>

 
 1. An Aerie Sentinel cannot be transported by a ship without a capacity value.
 
 
## Wing Transfer (Breakthrough)</sub>

 
 1. If the Argent player produces units on their turn in the active system, they will have to satisfy fleet pool and capacity limits there before they may move units to adjacent systems.
