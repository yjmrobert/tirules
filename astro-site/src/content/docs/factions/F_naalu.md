## Telepathic

 
 1. The Naalu player retains the Naalu 0 token, even if an effect such as the <i>Imperial Arbiter</i> law causes them to lose the strategy card it was on. The Naalu player will place the Naalu 0 token on another strategy card in this scenario.
 
 
## Foresight

 
 1. Using Foresight is not a retreat. As such, it cannot be cancelled with the <i>Intercept</i> action card.
 2. The command token is not spent. The Naalu player cannot use the <i>Scepter of Emelpar</i>, nor will they gain a trade good if they have the Muuat player’s <i>Alliance</i> promissory note.
 3. Fighters are moved without being transported. Ground forces may be transported.
 4. The Naalu player cannot use Foresight to move into a nebula or supernova.
 
    1. The Naalu player may use Foresight to move into an asteroid field only if they own the <i>Antimass Deflectors</i> technology.

 5. If the Naalu player uses Foresight to move out of a gravity rift, they will have to roll for removal.
 
    1. If all ships are removed, the strategy token will still be placed in the destination system.

 6. After moving, capacity and fleet pool limits apply in the destination system.
 7. If the destination system already contains one of the Naalu player’s command tokens, the command token from the Naalu player’s strategy pool is instead placed in their reinforcements.
 8. After resolving Foresight, play continues to the <b>Space Cannon Offense</b> step. Only the active player’s ships in the active system may be assigned hits.
 
 
## Gift of Prescience (Promissory Note)</sub>

 
 1. The player with <i>Gift of Prescience</i> retains the Naalu 0 token, even if an effect such as the <i>Imperial Arbiter</i> law causes them to lose the strategy card it was on. That player will place the Naalu 0 token on another strategy card in this scenario.
 
 
## Neuroglaive (Technology)</sub>

 
 1. The active player must meet fleet pool limits in all systems that contain their ships before they may proceed to the <b>Movement</b> step.
 2. If the Mahact player only has other players’ command tokens in their fleet pool when they trigger Neuroglaive, they must return one of those command tokens to that player’s reinforcements.
 
 
## Hybrid Crystal Fighter (Unit)</sub>

 
 
 
## Matriarch (Flagship)</sub>

 
 1. The committed fighters are returned to the space area when combat ends, and thus will not be on the planet for the <b>Establish Control</b> step. If the Naalu player does not commit at least one ground force to a planet and have it survive the combat, they will be unable to gain control of that planet, and the ground combat will end in a draw.
 2. Any structures on the planet will not be destroyed if the Naalu player committed no ground forces.
 3. The <i>Daxcive Animators</i> technology will not allow the Naalu player to gain control of a planet without committing a ground force.
 4. The committed fighters may be assigned hits during the <b>Space Cannon Defense</b> step.
 
 
## Z’eu (Agent)</sub>

 
 1. When the <i>Covert Legislation</i> agenda is revealed during the agenda phase, the Naalu player cannot look at the hidden agenda. Once the speaker has read the hidden agenda, the Naalu player may look at the next card of the agenda deck.
 
 
## Z’eu Ω (Agent)</sub>

 
 1. All other rules applying to tactical actions apply, other than placing a command token.
 
     1. The system cannot already contain a command token for the player performing the tactical action.
     2. A player may play a <i>Ceasefire</i> promissory note or discard the <i>Minister of Peace</i> law for their effects.
     3. If a player uses Z’eu Ω to activate a system containing another player’s units, that will count for the purposes of returning promissory notes, and other similar effects.
 
 2. The chosen player is considered to be the active player.
 3. If the chosen player is not the Naalu player, it is not considered their turn for game effects.
 
     1. They cannot use any “at the start/end of your turn” abilities.
     2. If the Yssaril player is chosen, and owns their <i>Transparasteel Plating</i> faction technology, other players may still play action cards during the action.
 
 4. If the chosen player is not the Naalu player, they may use any “before/after you perform an action” abilities.
 5. If the chosen player is not the Naalu player, abilities that would end their turn instead end their tactical action.
 6. If the chosen player is not the Naalu player, they cannot use the <i>Fleet Logistics</i> technology to perform an additional action.
 
     1. The chosen player may use the <i>Master Plan</i> action card or the <i>Minister of War</i> agenda to perform an additional action.
     2. If the chosen player is able to perform a component action, they may then use the ability of Suffi An, the Keleres commander, to perform additional actions.
 
 7. If the chosen player is not the Naalu player, and they had previously passed, they are still considered passed during their action. They do not pass at the end of the action.
 
     1. The chosen player cannot score the <i>Prove Endurance</i> secret objective at the end of their action.
     2. If the Yssaril player owns their <i>Transparasteel Plating</i> faction technology, and uses the ability of Ssruu, their agent, to duplicate the ability of Z’eu Ω, choosing a player that has passed, the chosen player cannot play action cards during their action.
 
 8. Any deal between the Naalu player and another player regarding which system will be activated, if made before Z’eu Ω is exhausted, is non–binding.
 
 
## Z’eu ΩΩ (Agent)</sub>

 
 1. Z’eu ΩΩ may be used whenever a command token is placed in a system. For example, it may be used when a player activates a system, when a player resolves the primary ability of the <i>Diplomacy</i> strategy card, or when a player resolves the <i>Signal Jamming</i> action card.
 
 
## M’aban (Commander)</sub>

 
 1. When producing units, the Naalu player must produce all the units they intend to produce before they may unlock M’aban. M’aban cannot be applied to the instance of producing the units that unlocks it.
 
    1. For example, before production, the Naalu player has ten fighters on the game board. They pay two resources during production. They cannot produce two fighters, unlock M’aban, then produce three more fighters. Instead, they would produce all four fighters, and then unlock M’aban.

 2. If the <i>Regulated Conscription</i> law is in play, the Naalu player may produce two fighters for one resource. This will count one towards their Production limit.
 3. If a game effect instructs the Naalu player to produce ships without using the Production ability, they may only produce additional fighters if that game effect allows them to produce fighters.
 4. The Naalu player may choose to produce one fighter for one resource. If they do, they may produce one additional fighter.
 
 
## M’aban Ω (Commander)</sub>

 
 1. The Naalu player cannot look at the agenda deck while a player is resolving the primary ability of the Politics strategy card.
 2. When the <i>Covert Legislation</i> agenda is revealed during the agenda phase, the Naalu player cannot look at the hidden agenda. Once the speaker has read the hidden agenda, the Naalu player may look at the next card of the agenda deck.
 
 
## The Oracle — C–Radium Geometry (Hero)</sub>

 
 1. Each other player chooses which promissory note they give the Naalu player.
 
 
## Iconoclast (Mech)</sub>

 
 1. The +1 will not apply to an opponent who has a relic but zero relic fragments.
 
 
## Iconoclast Ω (Mech)</sub>

 
 1. The ability will apply regardless of if the Iconoclast is in the space area or on a planet in the system.
 
 
## Iconoclast ΩΩ (Mech)</sub>

 
 1. The Naalu player must mandatorily place a mech when another player gains a relic, if they have at least one in their reinforcements.
 
 
## Mindsieve (Breakthrough)</sub>

 
 1. The Naalu player may only give promissory notes from their hand; they cannot give promissory notes that are in their play area.
 2. Giving a promissory note because of <i>Mindsieve</i> is not resolving a transaction.
