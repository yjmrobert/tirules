## Sundered

 
 
 
## Incursion

 
 1. Breaches are not wormholes.
 2. A system may have any number of breaches in it.
 
    1. If a player has a ship in a system containing multiple breaches at the end of the status phase, they may remove any or all of them.

 3. If the Rebellion player has no more breach tokens in their reinforcements, and an ability instructs them to place a breach, they may remove an inactive breach from the game board and place that.
 
    1. Active breaches cannot be removed in this manner. If every breach token is on the game board as an active breach, the Rebellion player cannot resolve abilities that would place additional breach tokens.

 
 
## The Sorrow

 
 
 
## Sever (Promissory Note)</sub>

 
 
 
## Subatomic Splicer (Technology)</sub>

 
 1. During a space combat in the Rebellion player’s home system, they cannot produce ships there while another player’s ships are present.
 2. The produced ships must still be paid for.
 
 
## Exile (Unit)</sub>

 
 1. The destroyer must be on the game board when the combat ends in order to place the breach. If the destroyer was in the active system, and was destroyed in the space combat, it cannot be used to place a breach.
 2. A breach may be placed after a space combat and/or a ground combat.
 
 
## Quietus (Flagship)</sub>

 
 1. The <i>Quietus</i> removes only the unit abilities from other players’ units; any text abilities are unaffected.
 
     1. Text abilities that rely on unit abilities, such as the space dock II text ability that defines “X” in that unit’s Production X ability, will have no effect.
     2. If a unit loses its Deploy ability, then the text that describes how that unit’s Deploy ability is used will have no effect.
 
 
 
## Ahk Ravin (Agent)</sub>

 
 1. If the Rebellion player transports ground forces during the swap, those ground forces will be placed in the space area of their destination system. They cannot be committed to planets in that system until and unless a tactical action is resolved in that system.
 
 
## Ahk Siever (Commander)</sub>

 
 1. If Ahk Siever is unlocked by placing a breach token into a system containing another player’s unit at the end of a combat with the ability of an Exile, the Rebellion player will not resolve the commodity ability of Ahk Siever from that same combat.
 
     1. If they place the breach token at the end of a space combat, they may resolve the commodity ability of Ahk Siever at the end of any ground combats during the same tactical action.
     2. If they place the breach token at the end of a ground combat in a system with multiple planets, they may resolve the commodity ability of Ahk Siever at the end of any later ground combats on different planets during the same tactical action.
 
 2. The Rebellion player does not have to be a participant in the combat to gain or convert commodities.
 3. If there are multiple combats in one turn, the Rebellion player may gain or convert a commodity for each. This includes for each ground combat on a separate planet.
 
 
## Homesick Phantom — Fragment Reality (Hero)</sub>

 
 1. The Rebellion player may only start placing ships on Homesick Phantom once the hero has been unlocked.
 2. When <i>Fragment Reality</i> is purged and the ships are placed in a system, the Rebellion player must remove ships, if required, to meet their fleet pool limit.
 3. Capacity is not checked during space combat. If the Rebellion player purges <i>Fragment Reality</i> and places fighters and/or ground forces in a system, they will not need to remove any fighters or ground forces from the space area to satisfy their capacity limit until after the combat has been resolved.
 
 
## Revenant (Mech)</sub>

 
 1. The Rebellion player may only Deploy one mech per tactical action, regardless of the number of planets in the active system.
 
 
## Resonance Generator (Breakthrough)</sub>

 
 1. The passive, movement ability of <i>Resonance Generator</i> is still in effect when the card is exhausted.
