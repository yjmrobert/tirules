## Indoctrination

 3. If the Yin player’s opponent only has mechs in the ground combat, Indoctrination cannot be used.
 
    1. If the Yin player is in a combat with the Naalu player, and the Naalu player is using the ability of their flagship, the <i>Matriarch</i>, to commit only fighters to the ground combat, Indoctrination cannot be used.

 1. When resolving Devotion, the Yin player chooses which ship is assigned the hit.
 
     1. The Yin cannot choose their own ships as targets.

## Greyfire Mutagen Ω (Promissory Note)</sub>

 
 1. A player may receive <i>Greyfire Mutagen Ω</i> in a transaction during a ground combat. If received at the start of ground combat, that player may play it immediately.
 
     1. A transaction must involve the active player. As such, the defender will be unable to receive <i>Greyfire Mutagen Ω</i>.
     2. The active player may perform a transaction with each other player at most once per turn. As such, the active player cannot receive <i>Greyfire Mutagen Ω</i> more than once per turn.
     3. If the active player received <i>Greyfire Mutagen Ω</i> on a previous turn, they may play it and immediately perform a transaction with the Yin player to regain it. However, <i>Greyfire Mutagen Ω</i> cannot be played twice in one timing window. The active player cannot play <i>Greyfire Mutagen Ω</i> again during the same ground combat.
     4. If an invasion involves ground combat on multiple planets, <i>Greyfire Mutagen Ω</i> may be played at the start of each of them.
 
 
 
## Impulse Core (Technology)</sub>

 
 1. When resolving <i>Impulse Core</i>, the Yin player’s opponent chooses which ship is assigned the hit.
 2. Effects that cancel hits, such as the Sustain Damage ability, may be used to cancel a hit produced by <i>Impulse Core</i>.
 3. <i>Impulse Core</i> will resolve before the <b>Anti–Fighter Barrage</b> step of a space combat. As such, any destroyed destroyers will not make an anti–fighter barrage roll.
 
 
## Yin Spinner (Technology)</sub>

 1. When the <i>Van Hauge</i> is destroyed, it will not destroy any of the Saar player’s Floating Factories present in the system.
 2. The <i>Van Hauge</i> will not destroy ground forces in the system. However, each player must then remove ground forces, if necessary, from the space area of that system to meet capacity limits.
 3. As both players will have zero ships in the active system after the Van Hauge is destroyed, the combat will end in a draw.
 
 
## Brother Milor (Agent)</sub>

 
 1. If all of a player’s ships are destroyed during combat, they may still place ships with this ability. If they do, combat will continue.
 
    1. If that player’s opponent has no ships remaining, that player will instead win that combat.

 2. Capacity is not checked during combat. As such a player may use Brother Milor to place fighters into a space combat where they have no spare capacity. After that combat ends, that player must remove fighters and/or ground forces to meet their capacity limit in that system.
 3. If the Yin player uses Brother Milor after the <i>Van Hauge</i> is destroyed during a space combat, they will win that combat.
 4. If all ships in the system are destroyed, and there are excess hits that have not been assigned to a ship, those hits will lapse, and cannot be assigned to the newly placed fighters.

 4. If the Yin player uses Brother Milor Ω after the <i>Van Hauge</i> is destroyed during a space combat, they will win that combat.
 5. If all units in the combat are destroyed, and there are excess hits that have not been assigned to a unit, those hits will lapse, and cannot be assigned to the newly placed units.

 7. If all ground forces on a planet are destroyed by hits produced from a bombardment roll, the player that produced those hits may score the <i>Make an Example of Their World</i> secret objective before the new infantry are placed.

## Brother Omar (Commander)</sub>

 
 1. If the <i>Regulated Conscription</i> law is in play, the Yin player may produce two infantry for one resource. This will count one towards their Production limit.
 2. If a game effect instructs the Yin player to produce units without using the Production ability, they may only produce infantry if that game effect allows them to produce infantry.
 3. The Yin player may choose to produce one infantry for one resource. If they do, they may produce one additional infantry.
 
 
## Brother Omar Ω (Commander)</sub>

 7. The <i>Parley</i> action card may be used on one planet when the Yin player resolves <i>Quantum Dissemination</i>.
 
     1. If the Yin player has no ships with capacity in the planet’s system, then the infantry will be removed from the board.
     2. If the Yin player does have ships with capacity in the planet’s system, then the infantry will be placed in the space area of the system. The Yin player might then need to remove infantry and/or fighters from the system to satisfy the capacity limit.
 
 
 
## Moyin’s Ashes (Mech)</sub>

 
 1. A Deploy ability may only be resolved for units in a player’s reinforcements. If all four Moyin’s Ashes are already on the board, no more may be deployed.
 
    1. If a Moyin’s Ashes is destroyed during combat, another may be deployed in a later combat during the same invasion.

 2. The removed unit must still be an infantry.
