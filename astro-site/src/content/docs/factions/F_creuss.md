## Quantum Entanglement

 
 1. The effect of the <i>Enforced Travel Ban</i> law does not affect the Creuss player.
 2. If the Creuss player has units or controls planets in a system with an alpha wormhole, and another player has units or controls planets in a system with a beta wormhole, or vice versa, then the Creuss player and that player are neighbors.
 
    1. The Mentak player may use their Pillage ability against the Creuss player in this manner.

 3. If Mecatol Rex contains an alpha wormhole, then the “For” effect of the <i>Ixthian Artifact</i> agenda will not affect the Creuss player’s units in a system with a beta wormhole (and no alpha wormhole), and vice versa.
 4. The Creuss player’s Quantum Entanglement ability applies to their units with the Deep Space Cannon ability. Other players cannot use Quantum Entanglement to produce hits from a unit with the Deep Space Cannon ability against the Creuss player’s units.
 
 
## Slipstream

 
 1. Slipstream does not apply to the Creuss Gate or to the <i>Hil Colish</i>, or to gamma wormholes.
 
 
## Creuss Gate

 
 1. A frontier token is placed in the Creuss Gate system during setup.
 2. Both the Creuss Gate and the Creuss home system (in standard game board setups) are on the edge of the board.
 
 
## Creuss IFF (Promissory Note)</sub>

 
 1. A player may receive the <i>Creuss IFF</i> in a transaction during their turn. If received at the start of that player’s turn, that player may play it immediately.
 
     1. The active player may perform a transaction with each other player at most once per turn. As such, the active player cannot receive the <i>Creuss IFF</i> more than once per turn.
     2. If the active player received the <i>Creuss IFF</i> on a previous turn, they may play it and immediately perform a transaction with the Creuss player to regain it. However, the <i>Creuss IFF</i> cannot be played twice in one timing window. The active player cannot play the <i>Creuss IFF</i> again until their next turn.
 
 2. Any deal between the Creuss player and another player regarding where the wormhole tokens will be placed, if made before the <i>Creuss IFF</i> is exchanged, is non–binding.
 3. The <i>Creuss IFF</i> may be played even if the Creuss player has not researched <i>Wormhole Generator</i>.
 4. The <i>Creuss IFF</i> cannot place wormhole tokens in the home system of an eliminated player.
 
 
## Dimensional Splicer (Technology)</sub>

 
 1. Any wormhole may trigger <i>Dimensional Splicer</i>, including the one produced by the ability of the <i>Hil Colish</i>
 2. One hit will be produced even if the system contains multiple wormholes.
 3. The Creuss player chooses which ship the hit is assigned to.
 4. The <i>Shields Holding</i> action card may be used to cancel the hit.
 5. The chosen ship may cancel the hit by using its Sustain Damage ability, if present. A different ship with the Sustain Damage ability cannot do so.
 
     1. If the chosen ship does so, the <i>Direct Hit</i> and/or <i>Reflective Shielding</i> action cards may be used.
 
 
 
## Wormhole Generator (Technology)</sub>

 
 1. This ability is mandatory for the Creuss player in every status phase after it has been researched.
 
    1. The Creuss player may move a wormhole token from the system it is in into the same system.

 2. <i>Wormhole Generator</i> cannot place wormhole tokens in the home system of an eliminated player.
 
 
## Wormhole Generator Ω (Technology)</sub>

 
 1. The Creuss player may move a wormhole token from the system it is in into the same system.
 2. <i>Wormhole Generator</i> cannot place wormhole tokens in the home system of an eliminated player.
 
 
## Hil Colish (Flagship)</sub>

 
 1. If the <i>Hil Colish</i> moves first, then the Creuss player uses the new position of the <i>Hil Colish</i> when determining if the active system may be reached by their other ships.
 2. If the <i>Hil Colish</i> moves last, then it may move itself into (or through, if its move value is increased) the Creuss Gate or Creuss home system. Before it does so, the Creuss player’s other ships may move through the wormhole created by the <i>Hil Colish</i>.
 
    1. The delta wormhole moves with the <i>Hil Colish</i>; it cannot move back to its origin system using its own delta wormhole.

 3. The Creuss player must declare all ships that will moving before they move the <i>Hil Colish</i> or their other ships. They then declare the path that the first ship(s) to move will travel along, and move those ship(s). They then declare the path that the other ship(s) to move will travel along, and move those ships. Any ships that were declared to move must, if it is possible to do so.
 
     1. If the <i>Hil Colish</i> is moved first, and is removed due to the effect of a gravity rift, other ships that were declared to move that can reach the destination system must do so, even if the path is through the gravity rift. Ships that cannot reach the active system do not move.
     2. The Creuss player cannot wait to see the result of their other ships’ gravity rift rolls before deciding to move the <i>Hil Colish</i>; they must declare if the <i>Hil Colish</i> is moving at the same time they declare which other ships are moving.
 
 4. If the <i>Hil Colish</i> moves before or after other ships, it does not generate a second <b>Space Cannon Offense</b> step.
 5. A unit with the Deep Space Cannon ability may produce hits in systems adjacent to that unit via the delta wormhole in the <i>Hil Colish</i>’s system. Most commonly, this will allow the Creuss player to target units in the <i>Hil Colish</i>’s system from the space cannon rolls of units in their home system.
 6. If an effect allows another player to move through a system that contains the Creuss player’s ships (such as the <i>Light/Wave Deflector</i> technology), that player may move through the delta wormhole in the <i>Hil Colish</i>’s system.
 7. During space combat involving the <i>Hil Colish</i>, either player may retreat to another system containing a delta wormhole, if that system meets the other requirements for retreating.
 
    1. If the <i>Hil Colish</i> is destroyed between the <b>Announce Retreats</b> step and the <b>Retreat</b> step, then the retreating player must retreat to a different eligible system. If no such system exists, then their retreat is cancelled.

 8. When the <i>Hil Colish</i> retreats, it may retreat before or after the Creuss player’s other ships, but cannot retreat in such a way that would prevent the other ships from retreating to the same system.
 
 
## Emissary Taivra (Agent)</sub>

 
 1. The Creuss player may use this ability to access the inactive wormhole nexus without a gamma wormhole. Moving ships into the wormhole nexus this way will cause it to flip.
 2. A delta wormhole in the system (such as from the <i>Hil Colish</i>) does not prevent this ability from being usable.
 3. If this ability is used, the active system will be adjacent to systems with delta wormholes.
 4. If a ship moves from the system containing the Ion Storm, it will not flip, unless the active player may move ships through the Ion Storm wormhole and chooses to do so.
 5. The system must have a non–delta wormhole in it at the moment of activation. If a wormhole is placed in a system with no other wormholes using the ability of an Icarus Drive, then Emissary Taivra cannot be used during the same activation.
 
    1. If a wormhole is placed at the start of a player’s turn in the system using the Creuss IFF, then Emissary Taivra may be used for the activation immediately following.

 
 
## Sai Seravus (Commander)</sub>

 
 1. The fighters are placed one at a time, until either one has been placed for each ship with capacity that moved through a wormhole, or the capacity of the system is reached.
 
     1. The Creuss player cannot remove a ground force to create capacity for a fighter.
     2. The Creuss cannot place additional fighters once they have fighters and infantry in the space area equal to their capacity in that system, even if they have unused fleet pool and the fighter II unit upgrade technology.
     3. If the Creuss player has a space dock in the active system, they may consider some of the fighters they place as held by the space dock, in order to continue placing fighters.
 
 2. This ability may be used whenever the Creuss player’s ships move, not just during the movement step of a tactical action.
 
     1. If the Creuss player retreats from a combat, then they will have no capacity in the active system, and so cannot place any fighters there.
     2. If the Mahact player uses their <i>Benediction</i> hero ability to move the Creuss player’s ships, then the Creuss player may use this ability.
 
 3. A ship may move out of a system and back into the same system during tactical action movement, if its move value is high enough. If the Creuss player does this with a ship with capacity, and moves in this manner via a wormhole, they may place a fighter, if possible.
 4. When the Creuss player moves a ship through a wormhole, ending in a system that contains an alpha or beta wormhole and unlocks Sai Seravus, they cannot apply its ability to that movement.
 
    1. If the Creuss player moves the <i>Hil Colish</i> separately from other ships during the same <b>Move Ships</b> step, Sai Seravus cannot unlock until all movement is completed.

 
 
## Riftwalker Meian — Singularity Reactor (Hero)</sub>

 
 1. Any units and tokens on either system are moved with their system.
 2. Systems that comprise The Fracture and the Rebellion player’s home system cannot be swapped with other system tiles.
 
 
## Icarus Drive (Mech)</sub>

 
 1. The Icarus Drive does not have to be in the activated system.
 2. The wormhole token is placed in the system the Icarus Drive was in.
 
 
## Particle Synthesis (Breakthrough)</sub>

 
 1. Each wormhole in the system provides the Production value and discount, even those of the same type.
 2. If the Creuss player moves the <i>Hil Colish</i> into a system, the Creuss player may use the Production ability of the associated delta wormhole during the production step of the same tactical action.
