## Ambush

 
 1. Game effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls do not affect dice rolls made when resolving the Ambush ability.
 2. If a cruiser or destroyer is removed before the Mentak player can resolve their Ambush ability, that ship cannot be one of the ships used when they do resolve their Ambush ability.
 3. The <i>Shields Holding</i> action card may be used to cancel the hit.
 4. A ship may cancel the hit by using its Sustain Damage ability, if present.
 
    1. If the chosen ship does so, the <i>Direct Hit</i> and/or <i>Reflective Shielding</i> action cards may be played.

 
 
## Pillage

 
 1. While the agenda phase and the Hacan player’s <i>Trade Convoys</i> promissory note allow a player to resolve transactions with all other players, they do not make that player neighbors with the Mentak player.
 2. Effects that force players to give objects to other players are not transactions.
 
    1. If Alice plays Bob’s <i>Trade Agreement</i> promissory note, then the Mentak player may use Pillage on Alice, but not Bob.

 3. If the Creuss player has units or controls planets in a system with an alpha wormhole, and the Mentak player has units or controls planets in a system with a beta wormhole, or vice versa, then the Creuss player and Mentak player are neighbors. The Mentak player may thus use their Pillage ability against the Creuss player.
 4. If the Winnu player owns <i>Lazax Gate Folding</i>, then the Mentak player may become neighbors with the Winnu player during the Winnu player’s tactical action. If so, the Mentak player may use their Pillage ability during this time.
 5. If a player would gain multiple trade goods one at a time, the Mentak player can use their Pillage ability for each trade good.
 6. If a game effect instructs a player to convert their commodities to trade goods, that player does not gain any trade goods from that effect. The Mentak player cannot use their Pillage ability for those trade goods.
 7. The Mentak player may use their Pillage ability even if the transaction does not involve trade goods.
 8. The Mentak player may use their Pillage ability against both players involved in a transaction.
 9. If the Mentak player resolves a transaction with another player, they may then use their Pillage ability against that player.
 
    1. The Mentak player does not decide to use their Pillage ability until after the transaction has been resolved. Any deal made to not use their Pillage ability before the transaction has been resolved is non–binding.

 
 
## Promise of Protection (Promissory Note)</sub>

 
 1. If the player with <i>Promise of Protection</i> in their play area resolves a transaction with another player, the Mentak player may still use their Pillage ability on that other player.
 2. <i>Promise of Protection</i> has no effect while it is in a player’s hand.
 3. <i>Promise of Protection</i> is returned when the system is activated, even if the active player will perform no hostile acts towards the Mentak player this turn.
 4. Activating a system containing only the Mentak player’s structures will still cause <i>Promise of Protection</i> to be returned.
 5. If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places a command counter in a system with the Mentak player’s units (for example, the primary ability of the <i>Diplomacy</i> strategy card), this will not cause <i>Promise of Protection</i> to be returned.
 
 
## Mirror Computing (Technology)</sub>

 
 1. If an effect specifically requires that trade goods are spent (for example, the <i>Negotiate Trade Routes</i> objective), <i>Mirror Computing</i> does not increase the value of those trade goods.
 
 
## Salvage Operations (Technology)</sub>

 
 1. The produced unit must be paid for.
 2. If the space combat ends in a draw, <i>Salvage Operations</i> has no effect.
 3. If the Mentak player wishes to place a unit using their <i>Salvage Operations</i> ability, but there are none of that type left in their reinforcements, they can remove a unit of that type from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead.
 4. If the opponent has a faction specific ship, including their flagship, destroyed, the Mentak player may use their <i>Salvage Operations</i> to produce a generic ship of the same type, or their <i>Fourth Moon</i>, as appropriate.
 5. The Mentak player cannot produce ground forces using <i>Salvage Operations</i>, even if their opponent has the ability to treat a ground force as a ship.
 6. The Mentak player cannot produce a war sun unless they have their war sun technology.
 
 
## Fourth Moon (Flagship)</sub>

 
 
 
## Suffi An (Agent)</sub>

 
 
 
## S’ula Mentarion (Commander)</sub>

 
 1. The Mentak player’s opponent chooses which promissory note they give to the Mentak player.
 2. Giving a promissory note because of S’ula Mentarion is not resolving a transaction.
 3. If the Mentak player resolves their <i>Salvage Operations</i> to place their fourth cruiser faction technology after winning a space combat, they cannot use the ability of S’ula Mentarion from winning that combat.
 4. If the Mentak player places their fourth cruiser during combat, such as by the effect of <i>Sleeper Cell</i>, they may unlock and use the ability of S’ula Mentarion at the end of that combat, should they win.
 
    1. The four cruisers need not survive until the end of combat; S’ula Mentarion is unlocked from the placement of the fourth cruiser on the game board.

 
 
## Ipswitch, Loose Cannon — Sleeper Cell (Hero)</sub>

 
 1. The Mentak player can trigger the <i>Sleeper Cell</i> ability, their Ambush ability, or any other “at the start of a space combat” abilities they have in any order.
 2. If ships are destroyed before the <i>Sleeper Cell</i> ability is triggered, the Mentak player cannot place those units.
 3. Fleet pool limits still apply during combat. However, if the Mentak player is at their fleet pool limit, they may still place a unit using this ability, but must then immediately remove a unit.
 4. Capacity is not checked during combat. As such, the Mentak player may place an unlimited number of fighters into a combat with this ability.
 5. If all of the Mentak player’s ships are destroyed, they may still place ships with this ability. If they do, combat will continue.
 6. No costs are paid for the placed units.
 7. Both players will choose and destroy one of their own ships in the active system for each hit their opponent produced during each round of combat, before the Mentak player places their ships for the <i>Sleeper Cell</i> ability. As such, the Mentak player may place a ship that was destroyed in the same round of combat, if they destroyed one of their opponent’s ships of the same type, even if they had none of that ship type in their reinforcements.
 
    1. When players would use their ships’ Sustain Damage abilities, they do so in alternating order, starting with the attacker. If the Mentak player uses a <i>Direct Hit</i> action card to destroy one of their opponent’s ships, they must then make the choice immediately if they will replace it using the <i>Sleeper Cell</i> ability, before any other ships may use their Sustain Damage ability. Should the Mentak version of the newly placed ship type have a Sustain Damage ability, it may then use it during the same combat round.

 8. If the Mentak player wishes to place a unit with this ability, but there are none of that type left in their reinforcements, they may remove a unit of that type from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead. This unit will be placed undamaged.
 9. If the opponent has a faction specific ship, including their flagship, destroyed, the Mentak player may place a generic ship of the same type, or their <i>Fourth Moon</i>, as appropriate.
 10. If the <i>Fourth Moon</i> is destroyed during combat, but the Mentak player then destroys their opponent’s flagship and places the <i>Fourth Moon</i> back into the combat, they cannot score the <i>Unveil Flagship</i> objective.
 
    1. If the Mentak player starts the combat without the <i>Fourth Moon</i>, and places it during the combat, they may score the <i>Unveil Flagship</i> objective if the <i>Fourth Moon</i> is not destroyed.

 11. If a destroyed unit is a ground force or structure, that the other player is treating as a ship due to some effect, the Mentak player cannot place that unit.
 12. The Mentak player cannot place a war sun unless they have their war sun technology.
 13. The opponent may still retreat during combat.
 
 
## Moll Terminus (Mech)</sub>

 
 1. If a player commits a mech to a planet that contains both a Moll Terminus mech and a PDS belonging to the Mentak player, then the committed mech cannot use its Sustain Damage ability to cancel any Space Cannon hits during that invasion.
 
 
## The Table’s Grace (Breakthrough)</sub>

 
 
 
## Corsair (Unit)</sub>

 
 1. If the active system contains a non–Mentak player’s units, the Mentak player may move a Corsair through systems containing any other player’s ships, not just those of the player in the active system.
 2. The ability of the Corsair may be triggered even if the Mentak player has some of their own units in the active system.
 3. The Nekro player cannot place a Valefar token on the Corsair card.
