## Antimass Deflectors

 
 1. The −1 applies to space cannon rolls during both the <b>Space Cannon Offense</b> and <b>Space Cannon Defense</b> steps.
 
 
## Dark Energy Tap

 
 1. A ship may be moved into the system containing the frontier token during the same action that it is explored.
 2. Exploring the frontier token happens at the end of the tactical action. Notably, this is after the <b>Space Cannon Offense</b> and/or <b>Space Combat</b> steps.
 3. Exploring the frontier token is mandatory if the player has a ship in the active system at the end of the tactical action.
 4. When a player gains <i>Dark Energy Tap</i>, they do not immediately explore any frontier tokens in systems containing their ships. They must activate those systems to explore those tokens.
 
    1. If a player moves or places a ship into a system outside of a tactical action, they cannot explore a frontier token in that system.

 5. The Saar player cannot explore a frontier token with a Floating Factory. However, if they produce a ship during the <b>Production</b> step, they will be able to use that ship to explore the token.
 6. A player cannot use <i>Dark Energy Tap</i> to retreat into a system that contains another player’s units, including ground forces and structures on planets.
 
 
## Gravity Drive

 
 
 
## Sling Relay

 
 1. The produced unit must be paid for.
 2. <i>Sling Relay</i> cannot be used without producing a unit.
 
 
## Fleet Logistics

 
 1. Effects that trigger at the start or end of a player’s turn will not trigger between each of those player’s actions.
 2. A player may use the ability of <i>Fleet Logistics</i> the same turn they gain it.
 3. If a player’s turn is ended by a game effect, they cannot use <i>Fleet Logistics</i> to perform an additional action.
 4. A player cannot use <i>Fleet Logistics</i> to pass on the same turn they performed an action.

## Light/Wave Deflector

 
 
 
## Neural Motivator

 
 1. <i>Neural Motivator</i> does not apply when a player draws action cards from either of the abilities of the <i>Politics</i> action card, or any other effect outside of the status phase.
 2. <i>Neural Motivator</i> only applies to the <b>Draw Action Card</b> step of the status phase. It does not apply when a player draws action cards due to the effect of the <i>Minister of Policy</i> law or similar effects.
 
 
## Psychoarchaeology

 
 1. When researching a technology, each planet with a technology speciality can only be used to ignore a single prerequisite.
 2. Exhausting planets to gain trade goods can be done at any time during action phase, except when another ability is being resolved. For example, if a player has one of their planets with a technology specialty targeted with the <i>Uprising</i> action card, they cannot use <i>Psychoarchaeology</i> in response to gain a trade good.
 3. If multiple planets are exhausted, the trade goods are gained one at a time.

 2. Effects that cancel hits will only cancel hits based on the doubled number of hits.
 3. Ground forces that are participating in space combat as though they were ships do not double the hits they produce.
 
    1. Ships that are participating in ground combat as though they were ground forces double the hits they produce.

 4. A player with <i>X–89 Bacterial Weapon ΩΩ</i> must mandatorily exhaust each planet they make a bombardment roll against, even if they produce no hits.
 5. A war sun must target the same planet with all three of its bombardment dice.
 
    1. If a unit may roll additional bombardment dice, such as by the <i>Plasma Scoring</i> technology, that additional dice must target the same planet.

 6. A player may roll for bombardment against a planet that contains no ground forces.
 
 
## Plasma Scoring

 
 1. Only one additional dice is rolled for each bombardment or space cannon roll, regardless of how many units are using that ability.
 
     1. During an invasion in a system with multiple planets, only one unit will add a dice to its bombardment roll.
     2. During an invasion, if ground forces have been committed to multiple planets, <i>Plasma Scoring</i> will add an additional dice to the space cannon rolls for each planet during the <b>Space Cannon Defense</b> step.
 
 
 
## AI Development Algorithm

 
 1. When a player exhausts <i>AI Development Algorithm</i> to ignore a prerequisite of a unit upgrade technology that they are researching, they may still use <i>AI Development Algorithm</i> itself for meeting a warfare technology (red) prerequisite on that unit upgrade technology in the same manner as any other technology.
 
    1. For example, <i>AI Development Algorithm</i> alone may be used to research the Destroyer II unit upgrade.

## Magen Defense Grid Ω

 
 1. The player with <i>Magen Defense Grid Ω</i> chooses which ground force the hit is assigned to.
 2. The chosen ground force may cancel the hit by using its Sustain Damage ability, if present. A different ground force with the Sustain Damage ability cannot do so.
 3. If the last of a player’s ground forces in a ground combat are destroyed by the effect of <i>Magen Defense Grid Ω</i>, that player loses the combat immediately. They will be unable to use any “start of combat” abilities.
 
 
## Magen Defense Grid ΩΩ

 
 1. The player with <i>Magen Defense Grid ΩΩ</i> chooses which ground force the hit is assigned to.
 2. The chosen ground force may cancel the hit by using its Sustain Damage ability, if present. A different ground force with the Sustain Damage ability cannot do so.
 3. If the last of a player’s ground forces in a ground combat are destroyed by the effect of <i>Magen Defense Grid ΩΩ</i>, that player loses the combat immediately. They will be unable to use any “start of combat” abilities.
 4. <i>Magen Defense Grid ΩΩ</i> will place infantry regardless of who activates the system.
 5. If a player has multiple structures in the system, one infantry is placed with each.
 6. The infantry must be placed on the same planet as the structure.
 
    1. If the Saar player owns <i>Magen Defense Grid ΩΩ</i>, and a system containing a Floating Factory is activated, then the infantry will be placed in the space area.

 
 
## Self–Assembly Routines

 
 1. If multiple mechs are destroyed, the trade goods are gained one at a time.
 2. A mech cannot be placed in a space area with <i>Self–Assembly Routines</i>, and so cannot be placed in a system that does not contain a planet.
 3. If a player wishes to place a mech, but there are none left in their reinforcements, they may remove a mech from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead. The mech will be placed undamaged.
 4. A player will still gain the trade good for a destroyed mech if <i>Self–Assembly Routines</i> is exhausted.
 
 
## Duranium Armor

 
 1. A player must mandatorily repair a unit with <i>Duranium Armor</i> during each round of combat, if possible.
 2. A player uses <i>Duranium Armor</i> only once during each round of combat, at the end of the <b>Assign Hits</b> substep. Hits assigned outside of this substep will not allow <i>Duranium Armor</i> to repair an additional unit.
 3. <i>Duranium Armor</i> is used even if a player’s opponent produced no hits during a round of combat.
 4. If a player starts a combat with a damaged unit, they use <i>Duranium Armor</i> in the first round of combat.
 
    1. A player may use <i>Duranium Armor</i> to repair a unit damaged by Space Cannon or Bombardment hits that occurred immediately before the combat.

 5. If a unit is damaged during combat without using its Sustain Damage ability, it may be repaired by <i>Duranium Armor</i> during the same combat round.
 6. Only units participating in the combat may be chosen to be repaired.
 7. <i>Duranium Armor</i> can be used to repair a damaged unit which does not currently have the Sustain Damage ability.
 
 
## Assault Cannon

 
 1. A player with <i>Assault Cannon</i> must mandatorily resolve its ability if they meet the requirement.
 2. If a player loses ships before they can resolve the <i>Assault Cannon</i> ability, they will be unable to resolve it if they no longer have three or more non–fighter ships.
 
     1. This will most commonly happen when both players in a combat have <i>Assault Cannon</i>, and the defender has exactly three non–fighter ships.
     2. Examples of other abilities that may remove units at the start of a space combat include the Creuss player’s <i>Dimensional Splicer</i> faction technology ability, the Mentak player’s Ambush faction ability, the Yin player’s <i>Impulse Core</i> faction technology ability, as well as abilities such as the <i>Courageous to the End</i> action card or the <i>Reflective Shielding</i> action card that may trigger off of any of the previous abilities.
 
 3. A player may use an ability to add ships at the start of combat. If this brings the number of non–fighter ships to three or more, the player may then use the ability of <i>Assault Cannon</i>.
 
     1. Each other player may use one ability after that player has gained ships, and before that player has the opportunity to use the <i>Assault Cannon</i> ability. This may prevent that player from using the ability, as above.     2. Examples of abilities that may add units at the start of space combat include a combination of the Mentak player’s <i>Sleeper Cell</i> hero ability and their Ambush faction ability, the ability of the Nekro player’s flagship, <i>The Alastor</i>, and the Naaz–Rokha player’ <i>Eidolon</i> mech ability.
 
 4. Effects that cancel hits, such as Sustain Damage, cannot be used to prevent ships from being destroyed.
 
 
## Sarween Tools

 
 1. If units are produced without any unit using its Production ability, <i>Sarween Tools</i> will not provide a reduction to the cost.
 
 
## Scanlink Drone Network

 
 1. The units must be on the planet before the <b>Movement</b> step of the tactical action.
 
 
## Graviton Laser System

 
 1. If multiple players are resolving the Space Cannon ability of their units against the active player, the active player must resolve capacity limits after assigning one player’s hits and before the next player makes their space cannon roll.
 
 
## Predictive Intelligence

 
 1. Neither ability of <i>Predictive Intelligence</i> may be used if it is exhausted.
 2. If a player removes any tokens from their fleet pool, they will need to meet their new fleet pool limits before any other effects may resolve.
 
 
## Transit Diodes

 
 1. When resolving the ability of <i>Transit Diodes</i>, that player may remove ground forces from a system containing their command token.
 2. The ground forces may be removed from on a planet or from in a space area.
 3. The ground forces may be removed from different systems.
 4. The ground forces may be placed on different planets.
 5. If a mech is damaged when it is removed, it will remain damaged when it is placed.
 
 
## Integrated Economy

 
 1. The produced units must be paid for.
 2. There is no limit on the number of units produced, so long as the combined cost does not exceed the planet’s resource value.
 3. Two fighters or two infantry have a combined cost of one resource.
 4. A player may produce ships with <i>Integrated Economy</i>, unless another player has ships in the space area of that planet’s system.
