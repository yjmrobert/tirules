## Demilitarized Zone

## Freelancers

 
 1. A planet may be exhausted to spend its influence or resources, but not both.
 2. If a player is to gain multiple planets in a system, they choose the order in which they gain them, and explore each planet as they gain it before gaining the next. As such, a player cannot place ground forces produced by <i>Freelancers</i> on a planet in the active system that they are yet to gain and explore.
 3. If a player wishes to place a unit, but there are none of that type left in their reinforcements, they may remove a unit of that type from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead. This unit will be placed undamaged.

## Ion Storm

 
 1. The active player chooses which side of the Ion Storm token is initially face up.
 2. All ship movement is simultaneous. If the Ion Storm token system is the active system, and the token is currently on the alpha side, a player cannot move a ship from a system with an alpha wormhole, flip the token, then move a ship from a system with the beta wormhole (then flip the token again).
 
    1. The Creuss player may do this by moving their <i>Hil Colish</i> flagship before or after their other ships.

 3. If the Ion Storm token is in a system containing a wormhole of the same type, a player chooses which wormhole they use when moving through a wormhole of that type. The Ion Storm token only flips if it was the chosen wormhole.
 
    1. As a system is never adjacent to itself, a ship cannot move out through one wormhole and in through the other while remaining in the system. The ship must pass through another system with a wormhole to use both wormholes.

 4. If ships are moved through the Ion Storm token wormhole outside of the <b>Move Ship</b> or <b>Retreat</b> substeps of a tactical action, such as by the effect of the <i>Skilled Retreat</i> action card, the Ion Storm token is not flipped.
